# ProjectTracker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kennethlee/ProjectTracker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kennethlee/ProjectTracker)

ProjectTracker is a basic project management system (think of it as a simpler version of Pivotal Tracker) created using Ruby on Rails. This app was written using the TDD (Test-Driven Development) software methodology and includes a full test suite. Continuous deployment is handled by Travis CI.

A more comprehensive description is forthcoming.
